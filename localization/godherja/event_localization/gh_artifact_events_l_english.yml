I have in my possession some very rare books indeed, far above the sort of thing that would interest the riff-raff and common merchants.

 artifact.0011.desc:0 "As I was standing outside of my chambers, attempting to think of something else to do beyond my usual duties, I was approached by my court chaplain.

 artifact.0012.desc:0 "I walked into the library and was immediately greeted by the seemingly limitless stretches of shelves, each filled with books, their covers of various designs and colors. I looked around, wandering deeper into it, and found myself standing by one shelf, my hand coming up to touch the spines of the books which it held. I felt the hardness of their material, thinking of the pages each book had, and wondering what they may contain for me to read. I stopped and thought over what I may read."
