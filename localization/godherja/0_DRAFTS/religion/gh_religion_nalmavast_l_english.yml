The Nalmavast recognize there are many gods on [aeras|E], but only Nalma is venerated, all other deities belong to other peoples. It is only the benevolent Nalma that cares for the Narodlek and their herds. Nalma can take either the form of a large red heifer or a young maiden. In both forms Nalma’s skin is covered in a multitude of swirling, ever-repeating patterns alluding to the constant cycle of life and rebirth that governs the natural world."
