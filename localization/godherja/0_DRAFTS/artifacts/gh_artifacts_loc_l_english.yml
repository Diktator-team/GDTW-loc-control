Second, that Naramaššin's invasion was completely unjustified, as disproven by the countless records of Orasbaeli, Valthronax, and Tylonic provocations in the years leading up to the conflict. Finally, the assertion that the Arakkariac realm was left shattered and in retreat after the Battle of Paelon Hill, instead painting it as an important, but ultimately relatively small clash that merely proved the unprofitability of continued conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the work posits that the conquest would likely have been successful regardless, had the empire not disintegrated in a bloody civil war after its monarch died in the same year as the battle."

From their foundation in 572 IS under Boqqar Datesh of the [olani_dynasty|E], to their subsequent role in the Second [tetenik|E], Mekha explores their initial functions and procedures, and how exactly they first became embroiled in politics on both the local and regional scale. Then, the writing focuses on the local scale, with the gradual divergence of individual chapters from the original mission, their official split in 682 IS being described as a mere confirmation. It then traces their roles as the [boqqarut|E] declined, with their powers growing at the expense of the state, and explains how by the time of the Third [tetenik|E], several large [lodges|E] had effectively ceased following all but the most direct orders. According to Mekha, the [zalreb_dynasty|E] was practically irrelevant, and the [etami_tetenik|E] was largely the result of their erosion of centralized power, an interpretation which is seen as controversial at best, though the work is well-respected in general."

On page twelve of over two thousand (though half of them have long been lost and forgotten due to most scholars considering the writing to be 'subpar'), the Lich states that this is because "My glorious words will one day be beautiful holy texts! The people will worship me as divinity once I cast down their pathetic Gods! They must have their scripture! My words shall not be lost to history!"\n\nThe text was recovered by [anti_magi|E] Sir Krenaud den Vy, who ventured north with the knightly Peti Gisreddean band of 'the Companions of the Winking Rose', and assaulted Cheskovara in her fortress of 'Everblight'. While they of course ensured the tale sounded suitably epic, a technical reading of their reports and a cross-referencing of the various accounts make it clear that Cheskovara was already seemingly on the verge of death when they found her, and her army had largely been destroyed earlier, as mentioned in several passages."

 artifact_bookredlandsadventure_desc:0 "#size:15 This book was published in the early 1100s IS by a possibly-fictional adventurer known as Lexenir, and claims to detail his journey through the Redlands of southern Aironoi. It paints a vivid picture of mysterious cults roaming the wastes, abducting the innocent for use in mysterious and sinister rituals to serve dark purposes. It tells of Lexenir's encounters with no less than 11 different cults, each of which possessed their own strange and violent traditions. These traditions, which range from ritual cannibalism to human sacrifice to drinking the blood of Redrunner settlers, are described in excruciating detail, as is his heroism in saving people from such terrible fates. The people of the Redlands are described in ways that make them sound less than human, claiming that they hide themselves during the day due to the sun's deadly light.\n\nThe book is accompanied by a series of drawings, which Lexanir claims are traditional Redlander art, consisting of complicated patterns of shapes, arranged in complicated patterns that seem to suggest great monsters in their curving, spiraling lines. The book was received with mixed acclaim, and many have claimed that Lexenir, and his story, are both faked. Nonetheless, it provides those who live across the far-flung Empire a taste of the mysterious Redlands."

To say that the matter is treated lightly would be an understatement, with the tone being more akin to a jape than an academical writing.\n\nThe bulk of the work consists of a point by point refutation of the increasingly frantic pleas for support by Legon Iolianos of Legio XXVI 'Exodian' sent to both the Mayikrata itself, as well as the Aeschraeist administration of Oraispol. Procopion's main arguments against the existence of the Fog are the unreliability of tribal witnesses, the intristic absurdity of a magical phenomenon not apparently associated with either the Living or Dead schools, the ability to ascribe many of the strange events sighted to more mundane reasons, and Iolianos' alleged Axiaotheaist sympathies. The idea of allowing barbarian tribes to migrate into Aversaria proper is treated with especial mockery.\n\nNeedless to say, the work did not age well, and the Mayikrata has quietly disowned it and Master Procopion a few decades after its publication."

After being unable to decide upon a successor, the citizenry instead decided to pick a ruler from their ranks by gathering up all Magi and having each cast their vote upon who should take the throne. Thus was elected Eliaxa'cea, a great reformer and the first to bear the title of Archon.\n\nAfter a successful 17 year reign, rather than passing the throne to her eldest child as would be the norm, she decided to instead recall the Magi of the city to yet again pick a successor - and thus a 400 year long tradition was born."

A new edition is released every 50 years, with the primary source of the journals being the library within the Irōchi Damotada, where the collected writings of all those who have journeyed north are stored. This particular version was first compiled in 1239, and features tales of widespread devastation in the wake of [frodbrokna|E]. A large portion is dedicated to the ongoing bloody struggle between the Agionists and Wardenites, with several eyewitness accounts of major battles, and even an interview with the Wardenite Mamur about the situation, in which he outlines a methodical approach. This interview is contrasted with the woe of another traveler, telling of their several near-death experiences while hiding from the Order of the Blind Watcher. In addition, it tells of the courts of various Aversarian warlords, such as the writings of a traveler who was present with Legio XXI 'Axiaotheia' during their campaign against Aeschraes, the man who brought down their empire. The Chevaliens concern almost all of the volume's remaining contents, with the story of a single man's adventure with a mercenary company in Beid Faluh."

 artifact_vorpal_blade_desc:0 "Vorpal Swords are ancient enchanted blades with the ability to pass through anything, including walls, armour, and even the world itself. The only thing stopping it from passing through the ground below is the guard upon which it is mounted.\n\nAn ancient cache of some six thousand swords was first discovered by the [marcher|E] adventurers in Kalathipsomi around 550 IS, immediately sparking a small war as numerous factions—including the first [aversarian|E] colonists in the region—fought over the control of these wondrous armaments. In the ensuing conflict, the adventurers that armed themselves with the blades were slain nearly to the last man, as it was revealed that the swords harmlessly pass through anything... including flesh.\n\nOver the centuries, vorpal blades have been distributed far and wide as little more than idle curiosities, only valued by theatre troupes and con artists, with more than a few idioms, bedtime tales, and jokes emerging around the phrase 'Cutting like vorpal.'"

 artifact_warcoin_desc:0 "#size:15 Legionary coins were once currency used exclusively by the Aversarian Noble Legions starting some time in the late first century of Aversaria's existence. With massive legionary camps growing their own economies and often resembling small cities while on campaign and at siege, commerce was extremely important for the soldiers to barter for goods with one another and the camp followers. While Aversaria would not have a single unified currency until the 5th century, the Legions were quick to create coins such as this to facilitate trade and to pay soldiers.\n\nWhile the Deodoxican Reforms and the establishment of a central currency meant that the practice would end, with most coins being taken by the crown and melted down into the new currency, many coins would survive on in an honorary capacity. For acts of valor or as a sign of appreciation by a higher ranking soldier, these coins would be passed down. While worth their weight in gold both for materials and to collectors, it was tradition to hold onto it until it was time to give it to a comrade who was deserving of similar reward or until retirement. While rarer over time, some State Legions were still passing the coins as of the 13th century, when they could be worth nearly as much as a soldier's entire yearly pay."

 artifact_womanknights_desc:0 "#size:15 This book was written by Chevalien scholar Michon Andreaux sometime in the 11th century to compile numerous smaller works by various authors of his time which argued for or against the concept of a woman being bestowed the title of knight, most likely due to the dubbing of the female [anti_magi|E] Rose den va Kreysauns at the beginning of the century by the warlord King Anton Descradau.\n\nWhile there are many examples in Marcher history of women warriors, the specific title of knighthood is one that has nearly never been given to a woman. While the works are generally in support of women fighting and none dare try and blemish the name of the many Marcher heroes of the fairer sex, Andreaux ends the work by claiming that female knight's are themselves an attack against the 'strong and noble traditions' that the title holds, despite a begrudging admittance that Lady Rose's slaying of nearly a hundred undead and an Aversarian Magi before her 19th winter were somewhat impressive."

While the book covers most of her long reign, her victory over the dragon Arthenax, her massive magical powers and her shining reputation as the last competent Aautokratia before the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], over half of it is focused upon her famous origins. Primarily, it discusses the rather controversial point of her life, wherein she was born as Aeladaxos, but disliking her station as a male used powerful magics to embrace womanhood.\n\nThe author, one Magi Kalathros, spends much of his time criticizing the detractors of the concept. Kalathros points out that Aeliadias was an Aversarian Magi and performed her transformation completely of her own power and volition, and argues that it should be celebrated as a true feat of magic and self-expression."

Second, that Naramaššin's invasion was completely unjustified, as disproven by the countless records of Orasbaeli, Valthronax, and Tylonic provocations in the years leading up to the conflict. Finally, the assertion that the Arakkariac realm was left shattered and in retreat after the Battle of Paelon Hill, instead painting it as an important, but ultimately relatively small clash that merely proved the unprofitability of continued conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the work posits that the conquest would likely have been successful regardless, had the empire not disintegrated in a bloody civil war after its monarch died in the same year as the battle."

Starting from their mythical foundation in around 900 BI by two estranged siblings, it goes on to cover the fabled (and likely wildly exaggerated) three hundred years of war between the two thereafter, their opposing roles in the wars of the Crimson-Teal Leagues, their perpetual side switching in the Arakkariac invasion, their simultaneous betrayals of Parthe'naxa at Kallane due to the mistaken belief that she was conspiring with one against the other, and finally their downfall to Dhace'nox's armies in 7 BI, who had beforehand tricked both into fighting the other."

It is said that the treatise, as well as the actions, of the so-called Blue Robes sent Axiaothea into such a rage that she tore down the six centuries old Lavaticas quarters of her estate in Asiupoli, and ordered four legions to assault the Aironoiakaan, thus starting hostilities in earnest."

While generally respected and still widely circulated by healers, the book spends a controversial amount of time demanding the reader 'washeth the hands which heal in the purest of waters and alcohol', a step to most treatments most contemporary readers see as little more than time wasting ceremony. Another chapter often removed for not being worth the cost of printing speaks of diseases actually being spread by small evil beings unseen by human eyes, which is regularly regarded as a fit of fantasy when compared to the scientifically proven existence of humours."
 feature_book_topic_artifact_bookbookofthefallen:0 "The book is a listing of every name carved into the walls of the Crucible, the principle fortress on the border of [chevalie|E] and the [lichdoms|E]. It is customary for the comrades of fallen [antimagi|E] and soldiers who give their lives at the location to etch their names into the wall, sometimes with a short few words about them, and many pieces of Marcher poetry or literature discuss the wall in detail or use it as a metaphorical device. This booklet however, nearly 200 pages in length, eschews this to simply detail every name and any other sentences connected to it. While of little value to the casual reader, simply remarking upon its pages is quite the sobering experience."

Proclaiming the words 'Calysto Cayne' in harsh lettering on the first page, it appears to be the personal journal of Agionist Saint and (forgotten by most) infamous pirate Calysto.\n\nThe journal gives little time for personal writings or philosophy, and the sentence structure and spelling of much of it suggests Saint Calysto either possessed some form of impediment or had only became literate late in his life. What the journal does contain is numerous charts, graphs, musings and ideas. All show the signs of a master and inventive sailor capable of designing improvements to his own ships, but they also show several lists of various slave pens and marketplaces around Aversaria, with lists of best times to attack and shipping routes to transport slaves to safe havens. The end of the book even lists various [aversarian|E] nobles and magistrates, listing them as notable proponents of slavery to be 'eliminated'."

Maduex is exceptionally skilled with a blade, sharp with his tongue and wit, and stalwart of heart and in devotion to his Path, and battles evil [aversarian|E] Magi and warlords before joining the Sjalvolki to aid them in their fights. Maduex soon rises up the ranks, becomes the greatest of comrades with the Witch-Breaker himself, and then converts him to the Lifepath and becomes his Wayfather.\n\nThe most popular of Mitheux's works, the idea of imagining a history that isn't proved novel enough for the obvious... oddities in the narrative to be ignored, and it has since become popular for troubadors to reenact. Its popularity proved so great that it caused several Wayfathers to even attempt to travel with and convert the Sjalvolki themselves, to mixed results."

The book gives an entire quarter of its pages to how to fight and treat others honorably, the role of the peasantry in society, sage knowledge on protecting the weak and defeating the undead before spending the remaining 300 pages detailing profitable foreign markets, suggestions for negotiating mercenary payments, and known foreign fighting styles and how to kill their practitioners."
 feature_book_topic_artifact_bookclockworkcity:0 "The travelogues of the Chevalien waypriest Climent of Vascount, who received rare permission from the Kartharadd Imperator to visit their throne city in 427. The descriptions are almost utopian, speaking of a happy, loyal populace working in unison for the glory of their sovereign. Of course, this picture is in stark contrast with anything even unbiased scholars would say about the living conditions of the Imperium, leading many to dismiss the book as nothing but a propaganda piece written by Climent to ingratiate himself with his patron.\n\nOf much greater interest to the common reader, however, are the rather fascinating pages that talk about the city itself - an impressive metropole of marble and brass, with clockwork automata seemingly integrated into every facet of life. The credibility of these parts of the book have never been in question, for the Kartharaddi were widely known for their mastery of clockwork machinery.\n\nCuriously, though it would seem that the work originally referenced the name of the city several times, it is actually impossible to read these specific words. Depending on the reader, they are either simply blank gaps in the text, or garbled beyond recognition."

The book covers many techniques ranging from strange and foreign with inspirations claimed from the far corners of the world to which Eos himself traveled as a mercenary, but also on the fair and respectful treatment of enemies and allies. In contrast to many contemporary guides to warfare from Aversaria, the Eosian Sword Charter strongly focuses on respect, mercy, and the protection of the weak as 'righteous' ways to follow one's life and reach perfection as a warrior and as the personification of bravery."

One of the only three known major attempts to undertake this feat, it is noteworthy due to also being the only one of which records still survive - the 1101 one vanishing without a trace, and records of the 531 expedition by the Kartharaddi going up in cinders with the destruction of the Imperium.\n\nThough it had begun with great optimism, the team of magi and explorers would rapidly encounter escalating difficulties, a hostile and bleak landscape, rising background magic levels and exposure sickness. Ultimately, the team was forced to turn back several hundred leagues short of their goal, noting that no tower was visible from their location, and concluding that the source might be buried, or of a fundamentally different nature than the Sea Tower, but certainly inaccessible.\n\nDisturbingly, several members of the expedition went delirious by the time the party turned back, and instead pressed on to their almost certain demise."

Detailing a tantalizing romance between a dominating Aversarian magi and his demure slave, the book goes into excruciating detail about the methods of his romance and the obscene leather contraptions he uses in it. Widely considered poorly written and disgusting, it nonetheless seems to sell in obscene amounts."
 feature_book_topic_artifact_bookfourlodges:0 "Written in the late 1100s IS by a Damotan scholar known solely as Mekha, The Four [lodges|E] is a history of the major social organizations that define Damotan life. The bulk of the book is focused on a detailed exploration of the events that gradually shifted the [rayakuux_orders|E] into the specialized social groupings they are today. From their foundation in 572 IS under Boqqar Datesh of the [olani_dynasty|E], to their subsequent role in the Second [tetenik|E], Mekha explores their initial functions and procedures, and how exactly they first became embroiled in politics on both the local and regional scale. Then, the writing focuses on the local scale, with the gradual divergence of individual chapters from the original mission, their official split in 682 IS being described as a mere confirmation. It then traces their roles as the [boqqarut|E] declined, with their powers growing at the expense of the state, and explains how by the time of the Third [tetenik|E], several large [lodges|E] had effectively ceased following all but the most direct orders. According to Mekha, the [zalreb_dynasty|E] was practically irrelevant, and the [etami_tetenik|E] was largely the result of their erosion of centralized power, an interpretation which is seen as controversial at best, though the work is well-respected in general."

Primarily, the book details the ridiculousness of the idea that Aversaria is not already a Magi Fraternity. The author points out how only Aversarians are human, and only Magi truly human, and that all humans of the Aautokrata have the highest standard of life and greatest amount of rights in the known world. The author ends the book by suggesting that Oemanaid has sympathies for his slaves, and suggests they be executed for their beliefs."

Achieving Lichdom in the 7th century after journeying north and escaping her people, Cheskovara would proceed to become one of the Lichdoms many 'minor Liches', who spent most of her time struggling to carve out a necropolis and fight petty territorial wars with neighboring Liches without ever amassing enough power to mount a proper invasion south.\n\nThis memoir was likely written by several undead servants who, judging by several pages filled with curses and angered rebuttals of their 'brainless idiocy', were resurrected just to constantly follow Chernivmala and write down her words. On page twelve of over two thousand (though half of them have long been lost and forgotten due to most scholars considering the writing to be 'subpar'), the Lich states that this is because "My glorious words will one day be beautiful holy texts! The people will worship me as divinity once I cast down their pathetic Gods! They must have their scripture! My words shall not be lost to history!"\n\nThe text was recovered by Anti-Magi Sir Krenaud den Vy, who ventured north with the knightly Peti Gisreddean band of 'the Companions of the Winking Rose', and assaulted Cheskovara in her fortress of 'Everblight'. While they of course ensured the tale sounded suitably epic, a technical reading of their reports and a cross-referencing of the various accounts make it clear that Cheskovara was already seemingly on the verge of death when they found her, and her army had largely been destroyed earlier, as mentioned in several passages."

Though the frantic handwriting and annotiations are barely legible, it is one of the clearest glimpses into the origin and earliest sightings of the [fog|E].\n\nFirst speaking of the sudden appearance of large numbers of hitherto unknown tribal peoples from the continental interior, it then analyzes the bizarre and confused reports given by captives, and finally the first sightings of the phenomenon itself in 1203. The author, presumably the Legon, shines lights on his attempts to warn the government in Oraispol of the oncoming threat, only to receive silence at best, or outright mockery and accusations of treason at worst.\n\nThe final report is dated to 1221, the writer apparently having been mortally wounded during a battle against hirtherto-uncontacted tribals marching northwards for some unknown purpose. The very last passage records the vow given by all present to no longer serve the whims of any petty Aautokratir, but the interests of all humanity, and that the only enemy they shall know henceforth will be no man, but the corrupting embrace of the Fog itself."

In stark contrast to the previous edition, it never attempts to deny or even downplay its existence, and though the tone does its best to stay cold and academical, there are undeniable hints of urgency between the lines.\n\nThe booklet reports that all attempts by Magi sent out into Greater Aversaria to stall the Fog had been met with total failure, and that studies of its nature and origin yielded little information. Furthermore, it confirms previously unverified reports of tribal humans dwelling within, but remarks that all attempts at communication were met with hostility, and that the single living captive—who was virtually constantly attempting to commit suicide until they succeeded—spoke no language known to scholars or barbarian interpreters. \n\nFinally, it touches upon the rumours of a newly emergent, third school of magic associated with the Fog and used by tribal Magi, but makes no definitive judgement here, claiming that the current evidence is inconclusive at best."

Told by a contemporary, Jacot's comrade and believed best friend Sir Michael Vavassky, the book is considered a classic of Marcher poetry and comradery. Vavassky's loss and sadness at Jacot's horrible death at the hands of the Arch-Lich Silas Stavro—Jacot having given his life to ensure the Lich was distracted away from several wounded men (Vavassky included)—evident in every sentence and stanza of poetry added to break up each chapter.\n\nModern scholars have suggested that Jacot and Vavassky had a far closer relationship than friendship, though this remains highly controversial."

This eclectic thirty five volume work is his most well known and widely read. While the series purports itself to be a history, Mas'en Malik's unorthodox style leads to a work full of fanciful stories, surprisingly accurate historical accounts, a treasure trove of classic Southern poetry, and dozens—perhaps hundreds—of Dead Magic rituals hidden in coded language throughout the book. Naturally, faithfully copied versions of this work are quite valuable. Oddly Mas'en Malik was not known to have been a magi himself.

It tells of Lexenir's encounters with no less than 11 different cults, each of which possessed their own strange and violent traditions. These traditions, which range from ritual cannibalism to human sacrifice to drinking the blood of Redrunner settlers, are described in excruciating detail, as is his heroism in saving people from such terrible fates. The people of the Redlands are described in ways that make them sound less than human, claiming that they hide themselves during the day due to the sun's deadly light.\n\nThe book is accompanied by a series of drawings, which Lexanir claims are traditional Redlander art, consisting of complicated patterns of shapes, arranged in complicated patterns that seem to suggest great monsters in their curving, spiraling lines.

Procopion's main arguments against the existence of the Fog are the unreliability of tribal witnesses, the intristic absurdity of a magical phenomenon not apparently associated with either the Living or Dead schools, the ability to ascribe many of the strange events sighted to more mundane reasons, and Iolianos' alleged Axiaotheaist sympathies. The idea of allowing barbarian tribes to migrate into Aversaria proper is treated with special mockery.\n\nNeedless to say, the work did not age well, and the Mayikprolollan has quietly disowned it and Master Procopion a few decades after its publication."

After being unable to decide upon a successor, the citizenry instead decided to pick a ruler from their ranks by gathering up all magi and having each cast their vote upon who should take the throne. Thus was elected Eliaxa'cea, a great reformer and the first to bear the title of Arkonir.\n\nAfter a successful 17 year reign, rather than passing the throne to her eldest child as would be the norm, she decided to instead recall the magi of the city to yet again pick a successor - and thus a 400 year long tradition was born."

Many readers would no doubt struggle not to cry as the young maiden who serves as the protagonist for many of the works struggles with her feelings of self doubt and discovery, especially as she falls in love with her best friend, the female Magi Anatheama.

Several passages go so far as to call the Aautokratir a 'blithering idiot' who was 'in more danger of ending our rule in the valley as the Iyrossi'. An especially interesting passage details several small rebellions Dethediax was forced to negotiate or put down in secret to avoid an idiotic response from Oraispol, putting the common concept of the Iyrossi's 1000 years of servitude into question.

It starts by describing the arrival of a strange man to the [aversarian|E] camp, wearing a cloak made from the sewn together wings of crows and using the antler of an elk as a walking stick.

 feature_book_topic_adabyssianreport:0 "This booklet contains a long-form report from what appears to have been Adabyssian spies sent north to study the north and its people's in preparation for eventual invasion. With references to reports going back some 300 years before Frodbrokna, the report generally concludes with agreement that the denizens of Sarradon and Aversaria are most likely a distant cousin to humanity, and have more in common with humanlike animals than they do civilized species."
 feature_book_topic_aeladaxostoaeliadias:0 "This book is a widely printed publication detailing the life of Aautokratia Aeliadias who ruled during the late 6th century. While the book covers most of her long reign, her victory over the dragon Arthenax, her massive magical powers and her shining reputation as the last competent Aautokratia before the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], over half of it is focused upon her famous origins. Primarily, it discusses the rather controversial point of her life, wherein she was born as Aeladaxos, but disliking her station as a male used powerful magics to embrace womanhood.\n\nThe author, one Magi Kalathros, spends much of his time criticizing the detractors of the concept. Kalathros points out that Aeliadias was an Aversarian Magi and performed her transformation completely of her own power and volition, and argues that it should be celebrated as a true feat of magic and self-expression."
 feature_book_topic_afynehestoree:0 "An old tome in an older version of what may be the modern [chevalien|E] language, or possibly a new tome written by the average farmer. Whether the result of age or illiteracy, the book gives a rather fantastical description of [chevalien|E] history from [Concept('chevalie_migratory_era','the era of the Gallicader tribes')|E] all the way to the [red_river_war|E], where it suddenly ends as if never having been finished."
 feature_book_topic_amazingslaves:0 "Half fiction, half travel guide, this [aversarian|E] story is what happens when a [magi|E] attempts to make a pamphlet for slaving tips an enjoyable fantastical epic. Generally failing in both regards, the long multi-page description of the thighs of [sarradonian|E] women or the bizarre fourteen page hate filled rant about the author's rival Demetrios in the section about Iyrossi stewardship are generally strong indicators of what to expect from the story. The opening page, somehow, makes note that this specific copy is number 877 of over 2000."
 feature_book_topic_annalsofblank:0 "Widely postulated to have been the official history of the rulers of the Kartharaddi, the book is now practically worthless, as magical influences have rendered it completely devoid of useful information. Its contents vary based on the reader - some report that it is simply filled with nothing but blank pages, others that it is written in a language or script completely unknown to them, while another group claim that while the words are in their own tongue, the text seems to just be garbled nonsense with no discernible rhyme or reason, and that attempting to make sense of them leads to a splitting headache and feelings of nausea."
 feature_book_topic_arakkariacwar:0 "Unlike most other works on the topic, this dry and technical tome attempts to objectively analyze the Arakkariac War, which engulfed most of the proto-[aversarian|E] world from 338 BI to 332 BI.\n\nIt refutes numerous flawed views of the war that grip the popular imagination—for a start, that the Aversarians of Tower Isle were enslaved and ritually cannibalized after their conquest by the Arakkariacs in 393 BI. Second, that Naramaššin's invasion was completely unjustified, as disproven by the countless records of Orasbaeli, Valthronax, and Tylonic provocations in the years leading up to the conflict. Finally, the assertion that the Arakkariac realm was left shattered and in retreat after the Battle of Paelon Hill, instead painting it as an important, but ultimately relatively small clash that merely proved the unprofitability of continued conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the work posits that the conquest would likely have been successful regardless, had the empire not disintegrated in a bloody civil war after its monarch died in the same year as the battle."
 feature_book_topic_ataleoftwocities:0 "Part epic, part chronicle, this work follows the thousand odd years of legendary rivalry between the proto-[aversarian|E] city states of Valthronax and Andron. Starting from their mythical foundation in around 900 BI by two estranged siblings, it goes on to cover the fabled (and likely wildly exaggerated) three hundred years of war between the two thereafter, their opposing roles in the wars of the Crimson-Teal Leagues, their perpetual side switching in the Arakkariac invasion, their simultaneous betrayals of Parthe'naxa at Kallane due to the mistaken belief that she was conspiring with one against the other, and finally their downfall to Dhace'nox's armies in 7 BI, who had beforehand tricked both into fighting the other."
 feature_book_topic_aversariancookinginformational:0 "This is a rather... impractical cookbook discussing how to craft the finest and greatest eats in Aversaria. Seemingly written for the nobility, the costs of each ingredient is so exuberant that even the Aautokratir was most likely put out by them. Not only that, but each dish requires such obscene magical powers to craft that'd they'd each require hundreds of sacrifices. The book best serves as a conversation piece, primarily about how the Aversarians didn't end the world sooner. And vinegar in lead jars! Vinegar in lead jars!?"
 feature_book_topic_bannediyrossipoetry:0 "This book is a compilation of a hundred or so poems written by various Iyrossi literati over the breadth of the millenia since their enslavement. The vast majority of the poetry is either incredibly risqué or waxes at great length about the reflection of [aversarian|E] blood in moonlight. While strictly banned by the Aversarians, it is Iyrossi who have historically destroyed such books, fearing Aversarian retribution against their entire culture."
 feature_book_topic_bluerobetreatise:0 "This book is a copy of the original 37-page treatise penned by Magister Velaras 'Bleak Speaker' Kreyshati at the onset of the Blue Robe Rebellion. In here, he announced the Mayikprolollan Aironoiakaan's outright refusal to do further research on [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E], stating that no [aversarian|E] [magi|E] would be ordered like a dog, even at the behest of a petty aautokratia.\n\nThe treatise further stated that henceforth, the academy declares neutrality in the [imperial_civil_war|E], and implored all Aversarian citizens to resist any attempt to force them out of their stronghold. It is said that the treatise, as well as the actions, of the so-called Blue Robes sent Axiaothea into such a rage that she tore down the six centuries old Lavaticas quarters of her estate in Asiupoli, and ordered four legions to assault the Aironoiakaan, thus starting hostilities in earnest."
 feature_book_topic_bookofmaps:0 "This tome proudly bears the mark of the Aversarinas Enosi Cartegraftekon, or the Aversarian Cartographer's Union. Aversarian scholars are the only ones in the world (besides possibly the Adabyssians) who are known to have shown an interest in crafting truly accurate maps of the world, using a mix of science and magic to find the exact shape and size of every land mass. Traditionally, however, the territory of the Aautokrata is shown as far larger than it is in reality."
 feature_book_topic_bookofremedies:0 "This book is a listing of medicines and remedies for various diseases and ailments both common and obscure, with treatment using both the best ingredients available and local ingredients in order to ensure even the peasantry would benefit from its knowledge. While generally respected and still widely circulated by healers, the book spends a controversial amount of time demanding the reader 'washeth the hands which heal in the purest of waters and alcohol', a step to most treatments most contemporary readers see as little more than time wasting ceremony. Another chapter often removed for not being worth the cost of printing speaks of diseases actually being spread by small evil beings unseen by human eyes, which is regularly regarded as a fit of fantasy when compared to the scientifically proven existence of humours."
 feature_book_topic_bookofthefallen:0 "The book is a listing of every name carved into the walls of the Crucible, the principle fortress on the border of [chevalie|E] and the [lichdoms|E]. It is customary for the comrades of fallen [antimagi|E] and soldiers who give their lives at the location to etch their names into the wall, sometimes with a short few words about them, and many pieces of Marcher poetry or literature discuss the wall in detail or use it as a metaphorical device. This booklet however, nearly 200 pages in length, eschews this to simply detail every name and any other sentences connected to it. While of little value to the casual reader, simply remarking upon its pages is quite the sobering experience."
 feature_book_topic_burntgrimoire:0 "This book has had quite a beating, its edges burnt and dozens of pages missing (either torn out or burned). Still, the full power it once held is still noticeable, and it radiates a surprising amount of magical energy for so ugly a vessel."
 feature_book_topic_calystojournal:0 "This weather-beaten booklet is little more than a few dozen dirtied pages sealed within a cracked leather binding. Proclaiming the words 'Calysto Cayne' in harsh lettering on the first page, it appears to be the personal journal of Agionist Saint and (forgotten by most) infamous pirate Calysto.\n\nThe journal gives little time for personal writings or philosophy, and the sentence structure and spelling of much of it suggests Saint Calysto either possessed some form of impediment or had only became literate late in his life. What the journal does contain is numerous charts, graphs, musings and ideas. All show the signs of a master and inventive sailor capable of designing improvements to his own ships, but they also show several lists of various slave pens and marketplaces around Aversaria, with lists of best times to attack and shipping routes to transport slaves to safe havens. The end of the book even lists various [aversarian|E] nobles and magistrates, listing them as notable proponents of slavery to be 'eliminated'."
 feature_book_topic_chevalienknightinoraispol:0 "A Chevalien Knight in Oraispol, 1262, is a fantasy story by Chevalien scholar Mitheux Chridae imagining a Marcher knight named Maduex den va Chrisay in [GetTitleByKey('c_oraispol').GetNameNoTier] as the Sjalvolki conquer Aversaria around it. Maduex is exceptionally skilled with a blade, sharp with his tongue and wit, and stalwart of heart and in devotion to his Path, and battles evil [aversarian|E] Magi and warlords before joining the Sjalvolki to aid them in their fights. Maduex soon rises up the ranks, becomes the greatest of comrades with the Witch-Breaker himself, and then converts him to the Lifepath and becomes his Wayfather.\n\nThe most popular of Mitheux's works, the idea of imagining a history that isn't proved novel enough for the obvious... oddities in the narrative to be ignored, and it has since become popular for troubadors to reenact. Its popularity proved so great that it caused several Wayfathers to even attempt to travel with and convert the Sjalvolki themselves, to mixed results."
 feature_book_topic_chivalriccode:0 "The Chivalric Code is a treatise on how a true Chevalien knight should act in their day to day life. The book gives an entire quarter of its pages to how to fight and treat others honorably, the role of the peasantry in society, sage knowledge on protecting the weak and defeating the undead before spending the remaining 300 pages detailing profitable foreign markets, suggestions for negotiating mercenary payments, and known foreign fighting styles and how to kill their practitioners."
 feature_book_topic_clockworkcity:0 "The travelogues of the Chevalien waypriest Climent of Vascount, who received rare permission from the Kartharadd Imperator to visit their throne city in 427. The descriptions are almost utopian, speaking of a happy, loyal populace working in unison for the glory of their sovereign. Of course, this picture is in stark contrast with anything even unbiased scholars would say about the living conditions of the Imperium, leading many to dismiss the book as nothing but a propaganda piece written by Climent to ingratiate himself with his patron.\n\nOf much greater interest to the common reader, however, are the rather fascinating pages that talk about the city itself - an impressive metropole of marble and brass, with clockwork automata seemingly integrated into every facet of life. The credibility of these parts of the book have never been in question, for the Kartharaddi were widely known for their mastery of clockwork machinery.\n\nCuriously, though it would seem that the work originally referenced the name of the city several times, it is actually impossible to read these specific words. Depending on the reader, they are either simply blank gaps in the text, or garbled beyond recognition."
 feature_book_topic_compiledworksofvenodau:0 "This book is a compilation of the most popular plays, tales, poems and treatises written by the eccentric 9th century writer Abaël Venodau.

Known for his horrible brutality, mentorship of Aversarian warlord Gorassos, and loyalty to Aautokratir Aeschraes (commonly known as the 'Lord of the Ashes'), this work seems to have been in progress sometime around when he was mortally wounded by Legan Isacea of Legio XXI 'Axiaothea' and his final execution by his pupil Gorassos.\n\nWhile A Lilac Grove is often crudely written and filled with multiple spelling and grammar mistakes, if one were to read it not knowing its author, they would most likely find it an exceptionally tender and heart felt series of tales with a masterful ability to control emotions through prose. Many readers would no doubt struggle not to cry as the young maiden who serves as the protagonist for many of the works struggles with her feelings of self doubt and discovery, especially as she falls in love with her best friend, the female Magi Anatheama. Readers would also be infuriated by the final poem, marked as the second to last, where Jadiaxa (the protagonist) resolves to beg Anatheama to run away with her as their village is consumed by the [fog|E]... only for the works to end there, [karthyn_delenel|E] likely killed before he could finish the work."

Several passages go so far as to call the Aautokratir a 'blithering idiot' who was 'in more danger of ending our rule in the valley as the Iyrossi'. An especially interesting passage details several small rebellions Dethediax was forced to negotiate or put down in secret to avoid an idiotic response from [GetTitleByKey('c_oraispol').GetNameNoTier], putting the common concept of the Iyrossi's 1000 years of servitude into question.

Ultimately, the team was forced to turn back several hundred leagues short of their goal, noting that no tower was visible from their location, and concluding that the source might be buried, or of a fundamentally different nature than the Sea Tower, but certainly inaccessible.\n\nDisturbingly, several members of the expedition went delirious by the time the party turned back, and instead pressed on to their almost certain demise."

From their foundation in 572 IS under Boqqar Datesh of the [olani_dynasty|E], to their subsequent role in the Second [tetenik|E], Mekha explores their initial functions and procedures, and how exactly they first became embroiled in politics on both the local and regional scale. Then, the writing focuses on the local scale, with the gradual divergence of individual chapters from the original mission, their official split in 682 IS being described as a mere confirmation. It then traces their roles as the [boqqarut|E] declined, with their powers growing at the expense of the state, and explains how by the time of the Third [tetenik|E], several large [lodges|E] had effectively ceased following all but the most direct orders. According to Mekha, the [zalreb_dynasty|E] was practically irrelevant, and the [etami_tetenik|E] was largely the result of their erosion of centralized power, an interpretation which is seen as controversial at best, though the work is well-respected in general."

Primarily, the book details the ridiculousness of the idea that Aversaria is not already a Magi Fraternity. The author points out how only Aversarians are human, and only Magi truly human, and that all humans of the Aautokrata have the highest standard of life and greatest amount of rights in the known world.

On page twelve of over two thousand (though half of them have long been lost and forgotten due to most scholars considering the writing to be 'subpar'), the Lich states that this is because "My glorious words will one day be beautiful holy texts! The people will worship me as divinity once I cast down their pathetic Gods! They must have their scripture! My words shall not be lost to history!"\n\nThe text was recovered by Anti-Magi Sir Krenaud den Vy, who ventured north with the knightly [peti_gisreddean|E] band of 'the Companions of the Winking Rose', and assaulted Cheskovara in her fortress of 'Everblight'. While they of course ensured the tale sounded suitably epic, a technical reading of their reports and a cross-referencing of the various accounts make it clear that Cheskovara was already seemingly on the verge of death when they found her, and her army had largely been destroyed earlier, as mentioned in several passages."

The author, presumably the Legon, shines lights on his attempts to warn the government in [GetTitleByKey('c_oraispol').GetNameNoTier] of the oncoming threat, only to receive silence at best, or outright mockery and accusations of treason at worst.\n\nThe final report is dated to 1221, the writer apparently having been mortally wounded during a battle against hirtherto-uncontacted tribals marching northwards for some unknown purpose. The very last passage records the vow given by all present to no longer serve the whims of any petty Aautokratir, but the interests of all humanity, and that the only enemy they shall know henceforth will be no man, but the corrupting embrace of the Fog itself."

Furthermore, it confirms previously unverified reports of tribal humans dwelling within, but remarks that all attempts at communication were met with hostility, and that the single living captive—who was virtually constantly attempting to commit suicide until they succeeded—spoke no language known to scholars or barbarian interpreters. \n\nFinally, it touches upon the rumours of a newly emergent, third school of magic associated with the Fog and used by tribal Magi, but makes no definitive judgement here, claiming that the current evidence is inconclusive at best."

These traditions, which range from ritual cannibalism to human sacrifice to drinking the blood of Redrunner settlers, are described in excruciating detail, as is his heroism in saving people from such terrible fates. The people of the Redlands are described in ways that make them sound less than human, claiming that they hide themselves during the day due to the sun's deadly light.\n\nThe book is accompanied by a series of drawings, which Lexanir claims are traditional Redlander art, consisting of complicated patterns of shapes, arranged in complicated patterns that seem to suggest great monsters in their curving, spiraling lines. The book was received with mixed acclaim, and many have claimed that Lexenir, and his story, are both faked. Nonetheless, it provides those who live across the far-flung Empire a taste of the mysterious Redlands."
 feature_book_topic_refutation:0 "An official inquiry by the [mayikrata|E] into the then newly emergent [fog|E], written in 1211 by a certain Master Procopion. To say that the matter is treated lightly would be an understatement, with the tone being more akin to a jape than an academic text.\n\nThe bulk of the work consists of a point by point refutation of the increasingly frantic pleas for support by Legon Iolianos of Legio XXVI 'Exodian', sent to both the [GetTitleByKey('e_mayikprolollan').GetNameNoTier] itself and the Aeschraeist administration of [GetTitleByKey('c_oraispol').GetNameNoTier]. Procopion's main arguments against the existence of the Fog are the unreliability of tribal witnesses, the intristic absurdity of a magical phenomenon not apparently associated with either the Living or Dead schools, the ability to ascribe many of the strange events sighted to more mundane reasons, and Iolianos' alleged Axiaotheaist sympathies. The idea of allowing barbarian tribes to migrate into Aversaria proper is treated with special mockery.\n\nNeedless to say, the work did not age well, and the [GetTitleByKey('e_mayikprolollan').GetNameNoTier] has quietly disowned it and Master Procopion a few decades after its publication."
 feature_book_topic_rendingthechains:0 "Rending the Chains is a series of essays supposedly written by Saint Calysto, patron saint of the Agionist Order of Saint Calysto's Key. The book primarily discusses how best to free the needy, most notably by forcefully enslaving them and then having them work to the death in service to true believers so that they may be reincarnated in the next life as a true believer, who may then go to a positive afterlife upon death. While often held as gospel by Calysto's Order, many academics believe the book was actually written several decades after his death by non-Agionist writers."
 feature_book_topic_ruleofmany:0 "An analysis and praise of the curious political system of the proto-[aversarian|E] polis Naupyrna, written by a local aristocrat known as Kleistha'nax, likely in the late first century BI. Centuries of rule by the Aestraex dynasty were brought to an end in 421 BI when the city's last monarch, the vicious, insane and likely cannibalistic Dioxa'nex the Younger was toppled in a bloody coup that saw his entire line perish. After being unable to decide upon a successor, the citizenry instead decided to pick a ruler from their ranks by gathering up all magi and having each cast their vote upon who should take the throne. Thus was elected Eliaxa'cea, a great reformer and the first to bear the title of Arkonir.\n\nAfter a successful 17 year reign, rather than passing the throne to her eldest child as would be the norm, she decided to instead recall the magi of the city to yet again pick a successor - and thus a 400 year long tradition was born."
 feature_book_topic_saintslawbook:0 "This book is a collection of court hearings attended by or laws created by the Agionist Saint Dikaynos in his time as a jurist. Unlike most [aversarian|E] jurists, Dikaynos always insisted that the law must be held independently of ones station, race, or beliefs, and would commonly go through great pains to ensure that he was not privy to the names, gender or bloodline of whoever he was trying. While many of the cases have been stricken from the record or censored, it nonetheless serves as a strong guide to following the Dikaynsite method of fair law and jury."
 feature_book_topic_sarradoniansteps:0 "1001 Sarradonian Steps is a series of tales each taking place from the perspective of a member of a different Ritualist sect. While a deep cultural icon for Ritualists and generally considered one of the high marks of Sarradonian literature, the book was nevertheless woefully dated within decades of its publication, many of the sects mentioned in the book having either died out, collapsed into obscurity, split over some doctrinal dispute, merged with another sect, or been replaced by entirely new branches of the religion"
 feature_book_topic_seventy_seven_cities:0 "Demetrios of Chumau was a renowned half [chevalien|E], half [aversarian|E] writer whose two hundred books, treatises, pamphlets, poems, plays, and more cemented him as possibly the most important writer of the 10th century. His 'Seventy-Seven Cities' story both described in intricate detail and provided a short tale of what Demetrios considered the 77 greatest cities of the world, and even contains intricate descriptions of cities as far as the center of Adabyss or the mysterious lands of Shaxi-Shahai in the far east, all of which Demetrios claims to have seen for himself."

 feature_book_topic_silastavroaliveordead:0 "Silas Stavro - Alive or Dead!? is a series of Chevalien books and political pamphlets written by Abaël Venodau, an increasingly erratic Chevalien scholar, towards the end of his life. The series remains highly controversial to this day due to its seeming support of Stavroist beliefs; it claims that the Arch-Lich Silas Stavro was not, in fact, killed in his invasion of the Marches and defeat at the hands of the [champion_of_chevalie|E], but is actually alive and regularly visits the author to enjoy tea and debates about romance literature. Its detractors claim it is a good example of Venodau having gone insane, its supporters claim it as a fantastic metaphorical piece."
 feature_book_topic_sjalvolkipoetry:0 "A book of Sjalvolki poetry written by the Chevalien scholar Mitheux Chridae as part of his series of books detailing his journies with the Sjalvolki peoples during their invasions of Aversaria, each chapter provides a collection of a different tribe's poetry. Unlike the poetry of most western cultures, Sjalvolki poetry tends to take the form of battlefield poetry (or, as the Sjalvolki have taken a liking to ships, sailing poetry), and tends to be rather anarchic in structure and prose. Still, many of the verses remain inciteful or bely an oft ignored thoughtfulness to many of the Sjalvolki warlords, with several poems by Cenware Witch-Breaker himself especially standing out, especially a surprisingly melancholy one composed on the field of the Elysian Pass."
 feature_book_topic_taleofsirkoeveux:0 "The Tale of Sir Koeveux is a novelization of an old Marcher legend about the old Sir Koeveux, who became so lost in his old age that he somehow ended up north of the Lichdoms. The tales tell of Sir Koeveux fighting an immortal Ice Queen, her sinister Magi chancellors and knights, and an evil group of aliens with pitch-black skin. It is a cute tale, normally told to children for being so amusingly ridiculous."
 feature_book_topic_thedragonandthescorpion:0 "An epic retelling of the attempted conquest of the proto-[aversarian|E] world by the Sarradonian Arakkaraic Empire in the late 4th century BI. The tale, while certainly awe-inspiring, doesn't make even a modicum of an attempt at objectivity. The primary enemy general, Naramaššin ad Hadur, breaker of Naucipax, burner of Orasbael, and butcher of Artexis, is especially smeared into near absurdity. Meanwhile, the deeds of the Aversarian defenders are exaggerated to rival those of the First Men themselves."
 feature_book_topic_thedragontale:0 "'The Dragon Tale' is the famous history of the [war_of_the_thousand_dragons|E] by [aversarian|E] scholar Dexon Divantax. Describing in accuracy the civil war between the evil Dhaxiken and the good Letigano, along with the thieving dragons stealing the power of [magic|E] from good [aversarians|E] and joining Dhaxiken in attempting to destroy the memory of the Purest. While generally hailed as an extremely accurate and well researched, if slightly dramaticized, story of the war, several critics have noted that the author (despite claiming to have written it during the war) is actually a pen name for Davon Davaonter, who lived some 500 years after the events of the story."
 feature_book_topic_thekardwenwhatweknow:0 "This report was written by Legan Cromus Rex on his encounters with the strange Kardwen. Previously thought just fabrications of the superstitous Sjalvolki, this report was the first official acknowledgement of the people by any form of Imperial authority. It starts by describing the arrival of a strange man to the [aversarian|E] camp, wearing a cloak made from the sewn together wings of crows and using the antler of an elk as a walking stick. He then from his hilt lifted the severed head of a soldier who had dissapeared only a week beforehand. Seeing it as somekind of threat Cromus strucked the man dead where he stood. This was infact a mere gesture of reconciliation, Kardwen often exchange the heads of the fallen so that their spirits may enter the afterlife. This act, would unleash the wrath of the previously unknown Kardwen and result in the disastrous defeat of Legio XXIII.\n\nSent to the Aautokratir during the height of this conflict, Cromus depicts harrowing scenes on the frontier. Bodies gnawed to the bone hanging from every tree and men simply vanishing as they slept being common themes. Perhaps most unsettling of all, however, is the very tongue of the Kardwen themselves, which resembles the wind blowing through the trees and never rises above the volume of a whisper even when pleading for mercy."
 feature_book_topic_tragedyinoejeynica:0 "This series of essays by a mixed Aversarian-Chevalien group of scholars is an extensive look into what exact decisions and events came together to lead to the Sorrowing of Oejeynica and the rise of the Lichdoms. While possibly overly detailed and dry, the book does include some insights in magic and how to prevent some of its worst excesses."
 feature_book_topic_travelsofsaintkatharitos:0 "This book is an alleged autobiography by Saint Katharitos on various tales of his travels throughout Aversaria, [chevalie|E], and [sarradon|E]. The book is at various parts nail-biting, profound and heart-wrenching, and is generally considered Katharitos' seminal work. Widely reprinted, it is considered one of the greatest tales in the modern circulation, and plays based on it are widely popular around the known world."
 feature_book_topic_treatiseofgoodpractice:0 "This treatise is the guiding book which establishes the generally accepted good standard for the education of Magi in Aversaria under the [mayikrata|E] teaching system. Initially written alongside the Concordial Pact after the Chaos of the Seventh Century, it has since seen nearly 400 official revisions by the [mayikrata|E] over the years, and serves as an incredibly detailed guideline for the science of magic and the best practices in the teachings of it."
 feature_book_topic_whenaervalbleed:0 "Written in 773 by retired Magi and veteran of the Kartharaddi wars Periaxis Leisistratos, the book is an analysis of the infamous events of the night of [night_of_the_bleeding_moon_date|E], of which the author was a firsthand witness of himself. Part of a legion sent deep into Kartharaddi territory at the time of the catastrophe, he describes the rapid death, and writhing agony that preceded it, of almost the entire Imperium in harrowing detail matched by virtually no other work.\n\nHe also goes on to cast doubts on the claims that the aautokrata had caused the attack itself. In the two decades following the night, despite seeking information from countless magi and higher-ups in the army, he has never actually located anyone that was aware of what would happen on that fateful day in advance - in fact, all of Aversaria's forces were seemingly caught completely flat-footed. Instead, Periaxis posits that what transpired was actually an attempt at a massive magical attack upon the Empire itself, and that the cataclysm was in fact intended for Etepezea, but failed for reasons unkown."
 feature_book_topic_witchbreakerhero:0 "This book, written by Chevalien scholar Mitheux Chridae during his long journeys with the Sjalvolki in an attempt to learn more about their culture, serves as a biography of Cenware Witch-Breaker for contemporary Marcher readers. The foreword claims that all information was provided by the Witch-Breaker himself, along with his contemporaries, and follows him from the legendary Dovahking in which he singlehandedly defeated all opposition (including his own brother) without killing a single man to claim his tribe to the Battle of the Elysian Pass where Chridade ended his journeys with the Sjalvolki.\n\nExtolling praise at nearly every possible moment, and containing several tales that are seemingly complete fantasy, Mitheux goes so far as to even add a chapter about how great a ruler he imagines Cenware would be and to fantasize about what it would be like to have him as a personal friend. Normally derided for such things, it nonetheless has received scholarly notice as the most notable contemporary attempt to document the legendary figure's life."
 feature_book_topic_womanknights:0 "This book was written by Chevalien scholar Michon Andreaux sometime in the 11th century to compile numerous smaller works by various authors of his time which argued for or against the concept of a woman being bestowed the title of knight, most likely due to the dubbing of the female Anti-Magi Rose den va Kreysauns at the beginning of the century by the warlord King Anton Descradau.\n\nWhile there are many examples in Marcher history of women warriors, the specific title of knighthood is one that has nearly never been given to a woman. While the works are generally in support of women fighting and none dare try and blemish the name of the many Marcher heroes of the fairer sex, Andreaux ends the work by claiming that female knight's are themselves an attack against the 'strong and noble traditions' that the title holds, despite a begrudging admittance that Lady Rose's slaying of nearly a hundred undead and an [aversarian|E] Magi before her 19th winter were somewhat impressive."
