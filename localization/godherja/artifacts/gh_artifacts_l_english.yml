feature_book_topic_seventy_seven_cities:0 "Demetrios of Chumau was a renowned half [chevalien|E], half [aversarian|E] writer whose two hundred books, treatises, pamphlets, poems, plays, and more cemented him as possibly the most important writer of the 10th century. His 'Seventy-Seven Cities' story both described in intricate detail and provided a short tale of what Demetrios considered the 77 greatest cities of the world, and even contains intricate descriptions of cities as far as the center of Adabyss or the mysterious lands of Shaxi-Shahai in the far east, all of which Demetrios claims to have seen for himself."

feature_book_topic_kam_gutaran:0 "An ancient book transcribed from an even older scroll allegedly written from stories from the Ayyar tribes some 2000 years ago, the Kam-Guataran describes a hundred different trades in intricate detail in an effort to encourage people to master their profession. While many of the tips on individual careers are outdated, the general life advice is surprisingly powerful and exceedingly insightful."

Describing in accuracy the civil war between the evil Dhaxiken and the good Letigano, along with the thieving dragons stealing the power of [magic|E] from good [aversarians|E] and joining Dhaxiken in attempting to destroy the memory of the Purest. While generally hailed as an extremely accurate and well researched, if slightly dramaticized, story of the war, several critics have noted that the author (despite claiming to have written it during the war) is actually a pen name for Davon Davaonter, who lived some 500 years after the events of the story."

feature_book_topic_skull_of_the_purest:0 "A 9th century compendum and commentary of a series of now-lost scrolls by the 4th century Thebastrine cleric Vias Valon. The scrolls in question documented visions witnessed with the aid of the "Skull of the Purest", an enigmatic artifact of unknown origin, fate or even confirmed existence.\n\nThe visions themselves are often barely coherent, their subject most often (where there is a discernable subject at all) acts of extreme cruelty and boundless depravity committed by a race identified by Vias as the 'First Men' of Aagiokratan myth. Interspersed throughout the book are also commentaries and analyses of the unknown 9th century author of the compendum, most often from a theological standpoint.\n\nRegardless of the visions' veracity, there is a profoundly unsettling quality to the text, and some of the more sinister chapters are considered difficult to even read entirely. At multiple points, the 9th century compiler alludes to the existence of more scrolls by Vias Valon, but these were not included in the tome for reasons unknown."

Finally, the assertion that the Arakkariac realm was left shattered and in retreat after the Battle of Paelon Hill, instead painting it as an important, but ultimately relatively small clash that merely proved the unprofitability of continued conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the work posits that the conquest would likely have been successful regardless, had the empire not disintegrated in a bloody civil war after its monarch died in the same year as the battle."

Since then, numerous explanations have been put forward - a magical disaster, the effects of a particularly powerful Gedeora, but also more mundane causes - for example, intentional erasure from living memory after the loss of a war against one of its many rivals.\n\nEither way, its whereabouts remain unknown to this day, fuelling myths that the lost city is home to riches and power beyond human imagining."

Naturally, faithfully copied versions of this work are quite valuable. Oddly Mas'en Malik was not known to have been a magi himself.

Ultimately, the team was forced to turn back several hundred leagues short of their goal, noting that no tower was visible from their location, and concluding that the source might be buried, or of a fundamentally different nature than the Sea Tower, but certainly inaccessible.\n\nDisturbingly, several members of the expedition went delirious by the time the party turned back, and instead pressed on to their almost certain demise."

The author, presumably the Legon, shines lights on his attempts to warn the government in [GetTitleByKey('c_oraispol').GetNameNoTier] of the oncoming threat, only to receive silence at best, or outright mockery and accusations of treason at worst.\n\nThe final report is dated to 1221, the writer apparently having been mortally wounded during a battle against hirtherto-uncontacted tribals marching northwards for some unknown purpose.

Procopion's main arguments against the existence of the Fog are the unreliability of tribal witnesses, the intristic absurdity of a magical phenomenon not apparently associated with either the Living or Dead schools, the ability to ascribe many of the strange events sighted to more mundane reasons, and Iolianos' alleged Axiaotheaist sympathies. The idea of allowing barbarian tribes to migrate into Aversaria proper is treated with special mockery.\n\nNeedless to say, the work did not age well, and the [GetTitleByKey('e_mayikprolollan').GetNameNoTier] has quietly disowned it and Master Procopion a few decades after its publication."

Furthermore, it confirms previously unverified reports of tribal humans dwelling within, but remarks that all attempts at communication were met with hostility, and that the single living captive—who was virtually constantly attempting to commit suicide until they succeeded—spoke no language known to scholars or barbarian interpreters. \n\nFinally, it touches upon the rumours of a newly emergent, third school of magic associated with the Fog and used by tribal Magi, but makes no definitive judgement here, claiming that the current evidence is inconclusive at best."

The credibility of these parts of the book have never been in question, for the Kartharaddi were widely known for their mastery of clockwork machinery.\n\nCuriously, though it would seem that the work originally referenced the name of the city several times, it is actually impossible to read these specific words.

artifact_rehdyia_uddayir_spear_description:0 "Though now rusted, missing its handle and long bereft of its magic, this is the speartip which the legendary spellsword — and later, Queen of [sarradon|E] — Rehdyia Uddayir plunged into the [worldeater|E]'s colossal black eye, finally delivering the killing blow to the monstrous beast that had very nearly brought about the end of all civilization on the continent and beyond."

artifact_sculpture_mask_of_ankepy_ix_description:0 "The famously decadent and ostentatious Kemsarian king Ankepy IX certainly left behind a burial mask befitting of his title and personality. Not content with mere gold, Ankepy had his mask painstakingly casted from several magically-potent meteorites — a process that required the combined efforts of some of the greatest Sarradonian [magi|E] and metalsmiths of the time. This base was then encrusted with precious gems beyond count, with seemingly every variety that exists on [aeras|E] being present, while the mask's two mortal eyes are made of particularly large and impressive bloodcrystals.\n\nMost noteworthy, however, is the mask's "third eye". Like most Kemsarian sovereigns, Ankepy went to the afterlife accompanied by servants, however their sheer amount and rank — his high officials, consort, concubines, household staff, personal guard, [magi|E] cabal and tens of thousands of slaves - surpasses the excesses of even the vast majority of his predecessors and successors. All of these were ritually slain and their souls interred into a black gemstone of unknown origin that makes up the mask's third eye, so that they may continue to serve their master into eternity."

# Wardenite Relics

artifact_banner_wardenism_description:0 "Though there is no evidence to suggest that the [first_warden|E] only used one battle standard throughout the entirety of his life as often claimed, this banner is certainly the most famous — it was present at the landmark Battle of the Burning Key, which saw the decisive defeat of the Sarradonian Regent Ulathir by [wardenite|E] forces and the beginning of a thousand-year long dominance in the Sinhamiyah valley.\n\nDespite catching fire mid-battle and being the target of numerous enemy attempts of destruction, it would largely survive intact (likely due to the specific type of fabric used in its make, rather than a miracle as sometimes claimed) and serve as the rallying point for the outnumbered [wardenite|E] forces, and would subsequently give the battle its name."
artifact_seal_wardenism_name:0 "Seal of the First Warden"
artifact_seal_wardenism_description:0 "A plain clay seal bearing the image of a key surrounded by text too heavily weathered to make out.

artifact_crown_wardenism_name:0 "Crown of Arachas"
artifact_crown_wardenism_description:0 "Subject of one of the more famous episodes of the [first_warden|E]'s rise, this crown belonged to the infamous tyrant [arachas|E] before his demise at the conclusion of the very first [wardenite|E] uprising in Al-Ghazir. According to legend, after being recovered from the ashen remains of the late king's stronghold, it was immediately offered to the [wardenite|E] messiah — who rebuked the suggestion and instead ordered it sold for the purposes of charity.\n\nAlmost nothing remains of the headpiece's former glory but a corroded, broken skeleton. If one looks closely, they can still make out the twisted and damaged images of [ritualist|E] iconography, warped by the fire that took Arachas' own life."

Though their survival was highly fragmentary due to Kemsarian persecution and the ad-hoc nature in which most were recorded, and they have largely been superseded in importance by the Prophet's revelations, genuine surviving texts of this type are still held in high regard."
