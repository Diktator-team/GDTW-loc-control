 wood_law_name:0 "Wood-Law"
 wood_law_desc:0 "In the harsh, primeval wilderness of the Continental Interior most [magic|E] is performed according to the rules and customs of the so-called 'Wood-Law'. Most of its teachings regard the forces of [aspect_nature] as unkind and capricious, and carefully lay out the correct procedures and costs of requesting their assistance — costs that are most often paid in [aspect_blood]."

 silentspeak_name:0 "Silentspeak"
 silentspeak_desc:0 "Though today more commonly known as 'Fog Magic', the oracular arts of Silentspeak had in fact predated [frodbrokna|E] by centuries. Since the event, however, the school has seen a meteoric rise due to its ability to manipulate the [fog|E] and a seemingly worldwide surge in arcane power accompanying the appearance of the phenomenon."

 keepers_of_legends_desc:0 "The Keepers of Legends' origins are as mysterious as the origins of their people. An order of [magi|E] smiths, they work to keep the stories and practices of the Karzarad alive. The Keepers are decentralized, periodically moving throughout the diaspora of the Karzarad people to better fulfill their purpose. \n\nThe school is defined by an odd dichotomy of magical knowledge, as the Keepers are well-versed in the practical applications of the spells they store, ranging from intricate mechanical constructs crafted by their people to the various diseases said to have been used by cruel tyrants in the oldest legends - causing them to develop expertise in [aspect_metal|E] and [aspect_nature|E] spells.""

 school_of_esoterics_desc:0 "In the wake of the [halakdun|E] and the destruction of the [sirhad|E], Sarradonian [magi|E] organized themselves into various "petty Sirhad", really no more than modest networks of cabals clutching to deciphered and decoded tomes left behind by their mostly-dead or missing Sirhad predecessors. In the eastern part of the continent this took the form of the so-called School of Esoterics, an alliance of Magi academies and non-associated masters who based their studies upon a surviving corpus of texts centered around the practice of certain arts pertaining to those [arcana|E] who were considered to be "above" the affairs daily mortal life; namely [aspect_celestial], [aspect_dark], and [aspect_dream]."

In the west of the continent, this largely took the form of the School of Manifestations, whose practices were ordered around the more mundane and practical arts left behind by their extinguished Sirhad ancestors.\n\nWith their skills critical to maintaining the crumbling "Public Magics" which graced some of Sarradon's greatest metropoles, Magi of the School of Manifestations specialize in the [arcana|E] of [aspect_water], [aspect_metal], and [aspect_stone]."

 school_of_malignancies_desc:0 "Less a formalized Sarradonian School and more an alliance of convenience, the School of Malignancies is an umbrella under which any Sarradonian [magi|E] practicing an [arcana|E] of ill-repute is labelled. While never the subject to systemic bans, such practitioners face scrutiny and discrimination, though the usefulness of their art means that their talents are almost always in demand regardless of popular suspicion.\n\nArcana classified as part of the School of Malignancies include [aspect_death], [aspect_ice], and thanks to the trauma of the [halakdun|E] [aspect_blood]."
 
 obsidian_mirror_oneiroscopy_name:0 "Obsidian Mirror Oneiroscopy"
 obsidian_mirror_oneiroscopy_desc:0 "First come the nightmares, night after night where the [magi|E] dreams only of timelessly staring into an ink-black mirror. Then comes the voice, coming to the would-be practitioner from a nearly-invisible presence lurking just behind their shoulder, whispering truths into their left ear which fade with the rising dawn. Those Magi with the volition to listen (or those too weak-willed to shut the dreams out) soon find occult revelations spring to their mind, the culminations of the tutelage provided by the Presence in the Mirror. Originating in Sarradon, it is thought to be spread through 'infected' texts to particularly susceptible Magi. Having wormed its way across [aeras|E] like a cancer visitations have now occurred as far afield as the [continent|E].\n\nTo those Magi who do listen, the Presence provides teachings in the [arcana|E] of [aspect_dark], [aspect_air], and [aspect_dream]. In the long term Magi often suffer from declining sanity, and many of the maddest have disappeared into the Sarradonian Desert following whispered promises of unimaginable power held in a sealed vault somewhere beneath the trackless sands."

 greenwenders_of_sarradon_desc:0 "Here and there, scattered across Sarradon, a traveler will find patches of thick cedar forest, defiant holdouts from the slow drying of the continent and the hungry hearths of thousands of years of human civilization. The vindictive and hostile woods-spirits who guard these places speak of an ancient age where the forest spread across the whole of northern Sarradon; a time of ancient and terrible god-kings and older magics.\n\nThe Greenwenders are said to be the last remnants of that magic, which has otherwise been lost to time and the advancement of civilization. Derided in high society as dirty and strange, the Greenwenders operate in secretive fraternities scattered across the countryside of Central Sarradon."
 
 luminous_discipline_name:0 "Luminous Discipline"
 luminous_discipline_desc:0 "In the oldest stories of Kharadamat, handed down, perhaps, from a time when the word "Sarradon" meant nothing at all, [magi|E] are universally referred to by a singular, and perhaps strange, term. For while modern retellings will often use the word "Magi", the more accurate translation of that ancient term would be 'Practitioner of the Luminous Discipline'. And while the Sarradonian cultures that inhabit most of the peninsula might view this as a mere quirk of language, to the Dezhunic peoples of the Kharadamatian interior, it means something far greater.\n\nBecause to them, that Luminous Discipline is still practiced as in the ancient stories. While not a well-defined system of magic like is practiced by their Sarradonian neighbors, or the Aversarians across the sea, these ancient rites still hold sway over the forces of [aspect_light] and [aspect_fire], and will continue to do so for as long as those stories are told."

Traditionally they act as Wise Ones or Soothsayers throughout the archipelago, though their skills of astronomy and navigation are highly sought after by any ships that can afford them, as the water ways of the [pirate_coast|E] are known to be quite treacherous.

 #Islands
 amber_cup_rites_name:0 "Amber Cup Rites"
 amber_cup_rites_desc:0 "A [magi|E] art born out of the depths of the Sea of Empires, the Amber Cup Rite is apocryphally cited as having descended from fifty-five traditional lodges founded in the rocky slopes of the old home isles of the Krehejad, though that distant and bygone age of myth and heroes is now shaded with more legend than history.\n\nNow found along most coastal communities in [aversaria|E] and especially concentrated in the isles of the shattered coast, adherents to the Amber Cup ritualistically cast away material attachment, often through ecstatic rites involving ritualistic wine consumption. Though derided as "hedge magi" or "drunken pagans" by their detractors in the more formalized and urban Aversarian schools of Magi, even those critics must admit that the rites of the Magi of the Cup seem to instill a deep and almost instinctual command over the secrets of [aspect_water] and [aspect_air]."

 #Damota
 songs_of_service_and_sight_name:0 "Songs of Service and Sight"
 songs_of_service_and_sight_desc:0 "The Songs of Service and Sight are a commonly-applied synecdoche for the traditional Damotan practices of Magic, pieced together from centuries of oral tradition and greatly revolutionized under the Boqqars' attempts to study the ruins of the Most High's original followers. The two words which name the loosely-defined school serve to emphasize the role played by these practitioners in society, and to combine the great knowledge which they access with the duty owed to their communities and rulers.\n\nIn practical terms, Singers of the Songs are expected to combine an ancient set of practical rituals to control the natural environment with a masterful knowledge of the world's will—manifesting as a famed ability to both predict and influence events yet to pass. Despite the less-prestigious role played by [magi|E] compared to some other cultures, even Aversarian scholars have been impressed by the command of [aspect_light], [aspect_nature], and even [aspect_dream] Magic displayed by some practitioners."

 chants_of_the_tomb_name:0 "Chants of the Tomb"
 chants_of_the_tomb_desc:0 "While Damotan magic has long followed a strict orthodoxy in direction, rumors have always abounded of those who broke away from such restrictions, seeking powers never meant for mortal men. Most famed—and feared—of this magical underworld's secrets are the Chants of the Tomb, which promise their Singers a twisted form of powers once belonging only to the Most High.\n\nHighly esoteric, this long-suppressed branch of Damotan magic focuses on understanding the elementary mechanics of life, and has supposedly been responsible for all manner of monstrosities. Nonetheless, there will likely always be a small contingent delving further into the mysteries of [aspect_death], [aspect_ethereal], and [aspect_blood] magic."

 dirges_of_the_burned_and_broken_desc:0 "Traditionally, Magi have played a minor role in Damotan warfare. Unlike in many of the lands traversed by their pilgrims, the use of purely-destructive magic has long been highly frowned-upon. Nonetheless, practicality has demanded that Damotan rulers attempt to foster an understanding of these foreign ways of magic.\n\nIn radical divergence from the rest of Damota’s magical traditions, the Singers of the Dirges are focused on the use of magic in battle, and countless shattered walls, burned villages, and fallow fields mark the trail of these practitioners. Yet, so long as there is war in Damota, there will be demand for these death-bringers, who combine a traditional knowledge of [aspect_nature] with the [aspect_fire] and [aspect_stone] of the North."


 #Clanlanders
 day_court_name:0 "Day Court"
 day_court_desc:0 "The native Clanlanders of Kalathipsomi traditionally derive most of their [magic|E] from pacts with various kinds of nature spirits. According to folklore, these entities fall under the domains of either the 'Day' or 'Night' courts - so named both for the times of day they are thought to be at their most powerful and their general demeanor. The spirits of the Day Court, though not benevolent, are usually characterized as far more amenable to humanity than their Night Court counterparts. Fairies, sprites, pixies and most elementals fall under this category; when respected and properly bargained with, they are known to lend their assistance chiefly with [aspect_light|E], [aspect_dream|E] and [aspect_nature|E] [magic|E].

According to folklore, these entities fall under the domains of either the 'Day' or 'Night' courts - so named both for the times of day they are thought to be at their most powerful and their general demeanor. The Night Court has historically been the far more maligned and shunned of the two. Considering the kinds of spirits that fall within its domain — shadowfae, boogeymen, venderja and dark beings even more ancient — this is perhaps understandable. Bargains with these entities are never a safe nor sane affair, but the often nightmarish powers of [aspect_dark|E], [aspect_dream|E] and [aspect_nature|E] that they can lend are a force to be reckoned with."

 spirit_voice_desc:0 "It is said that when the winds blow across the vast steppes, it carries with them the voices of those that have passed beyond. To the Öltenic tribes, the veil between life and death is often thin, and their shamans are well-versed in harnessing the spirits around them to aid in their spellcasting. \n\nThis ritualistic way of magic has been named the Spiritvoice, as practitioners are heard to speak incantations with voices not of their own. The Speakers, as they are called, oft use spirits to aid in divination or calling upon them to strengthen the winds, making them adept in the aspects of [aspect_dream|E] and [aspect_air|E]."

 #Kashirya
 empiricists_name:0 "Empiricists"
 empiricists_desc:0 "The dominant school of Vidvaookeyatran [magic|E] theory, the Empiricist school is based on a rigid epistemological system that only accepts observation and inference as valid means of gaining insight. Although the school initially considered divination a valid source of knowledge, early disputes have since revised their position on visionary techniques.\n\nThis school has since developed a relatively coherent atomic system of describing reality, using the terms like substances, qualities, and additional ontological categories. While Empiricists are not materialists, their stance on epistemology has caused them to excel primarily in the manipulation of the physical world, resulting in a renowned tradition of elemental magic focusing on the aspects of [aspect_fire], [aspect_water] and [aspect_stone]."

 oraculars_name:0 "Oraculars"
 oraculars_desc:0 "The Oracular school came into being once the experiments of Empiricism led to discoveries that came into conflict with the oldest extant Avastya Mahani religious texts. The conservative scholar Shiramah criticized the mainstream school in his [Concept('87_theses','treatises')|E], resulting in the belief that although 'Empiricist knowledge' is still respected, it is believed to be inferior to personal experiences of the divine.\n\nThis stance has led Oraculars to develop a strain of magic focused on the shaping of minds and revelatory techniques, making its practitioners well-versed in the casting of [aspect_dream] and [aspect_celestial] spells."
