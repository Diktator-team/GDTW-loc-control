Born from the great migration into the Shattered Coast, the [struggle|E] shifts between [struggle_phase_phases|E] of violence, wary truces, and pragmatic cooperation. There are few permanent allies and [rulers|E] should be wary of relying purely on a shared [faith|E] or [culture|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_rite_wars_south_opportunity_desc:2 "After a long period of relatively peaceful coexistence during the [struggle_phase_rite_wars_south_conciliation|E], complacency begins to set in. Peasantry and nobility alike are comfortable that things just #EMP work#!, allowing more shrewd [characters|E] to take advantage of their naivety.\n\nEventually, fresh abuses will either cause an escalation into the [struggle_phase_rite_wars_south_hostility|E], or else savvy politicking reaches an uneasy equilibrium through the [struggle_phase_rite_wars_south_conciliation|E]."

Repeated acts of malice and escalated misunderstandings during  the [struggle_phase_rite_wars_south_opportunity|E] have lead to rising hatred of [characters|E] with differing [cultures|E], [faiths|E], or #EMP worse#!: both.\n\nSuch bloodshed cannot persist forever, though.
