## Postcards from your Adventurer by Isabella Welch

#Aironoi I

 fund_inspiration.6001.t:0 "The Steppe and saddle gallop through my heart,"
 fund_inspiration.6001.desc:0 "I have riding for months on end. My rear shall never recover! I've acquired quite the taste for fermented mare's milk and nights beneath the open sky.\n\nWith this courier, I send a carved tip of a Morin Khuur — the decorative horse head placed atop instruments. Perhaps you have a use for it."
 fund_inspiration.6001.a:0 "I'll hold onto this!"
 fund_inspiration.6001.b:0 "Send it to the Court Musician."

#Kashirya

 fund_inspiration.6002.t:0 "My jaunt through Kashirya marches on!"
 fund_inspiration.6002.desc:0 "I am near-blinded by all the gems the courts I visit have to show me. I find myself yearning for the filth of the open road.\n\nI have sent a courier with a particularly tasteless gift I was given — a tiger's head ornament on a ring, with jewels for eyes. Have you ever seen something so garish?"
 fund_inspiration.6002.a:0 "I rather like it, it's his loss."
 fund_inspiration.6002.b:0 "Ghastly! Take it apart and sell the gems."

#Sarradon

 fund_inspiration.6003.t:0 "I dream of the desert,"
 fund_inspiration.6003.desc:0 "My liege, my journey to Sarradon is underway, and I have joined a camel train traversing the width of the land.\n\nI send to you a piece of jewelry one of my fellow travelers granted me — a most delicate necklace covered in ostrich shell beads. I suppose you haven't seen an ostrich."
 fund_inspiration.6003.a:0 "A fine find! I will wear it myself."
 fund_inspiration.6003.b:1 "I shall give it to [event_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."

#Sarradon (Pilgrimage areas)

 fund_inspiration.6004.t:0 "Ah, to be a pilgrim,"
 fund_inspiration.6004.desc:0 "My journey through Sarradon has mostly involved fighting off hoards of peddlers on the pilgrim-paths.\n\nOft, in order not to delay my quest over-long, I give in and buy one of their little trinkets. I have sent a courier bearing the tat your way. Perhaps it shall provide some amusement."
 fund_inspiration.6004.a:0 "What use is an adventurer who takes the common path?"
 fund_inspiration.6004.b:0 "These are some pretty baubles..."

#Europe (Disabled)

 fund_inspiration.6005.t:0 "My adventures are sodden,"
 fund_inspiration.6005.desc:0 "My Lord, I have found a few trite relics so far in my adventures, which I have sent with this courier, but I am unsure what I may uncover next.\n\nThe Europeans are the smelliest creatures I have encountered. As a child, I dreamt of the green and pleasant meadows, but I am convinced half of this world is made of mud. If you are a gracious liege, please send word to call me back."
 fund_inspiration.6005.a:0 "This isn't a holiday! Quest on!"
 fund_inspiration.6005.b:0 "Poor soul, I suppose these rewards shall suffice."
 fund_inspiration.6005.b.tt:0 "You permit [inspiration_owner.GetTitledFirstName] to return home"

#Aironoi II

 fund_inspiration.6006.t:0 "Greetings from Aironoi,"
 fund_inspiration.6006.desc:0 "My travels throughout Aironoi have left me with quite a taste for lamb, yogurt and eggplants, and I have sent some recipes along with this courier.\n\nI have been given a golden brooch adorned with a seahorse by one of my hosts, which I also send to you. I'm certain my travels will bring further wonders in due time."
 fund_inspiration.6006.a:0 "Order our chefs to prepare these dishes at once!"
 fund_inspiration.6006.b:0 "[inspiration_owner.GetSheHe|U] seems to be having too much fun on this quest..."

#Aironoi III
 fund_inspiration.6503.t:0 "$fund_inspiration.title$ Whispers of the Past"
 fund_inspiration.6503.desc:0 "\n\n'I have delved into a Kurgan, an ancient burial mound made by the Ölteni. Hundreds of long-perished horses, stuffed, preserved, and staked to the walls to stand upright, each with their own room. It was a stable for the damned, lost to time.\n\n'Knowing of my duty to seek knowledge for our realm, I considered stealing a relic from the tomb when my guide was not watching to bring to you."
 fund_inspiration.6503.a:0 "You pocketed one of the ornaments."
 fund_inspiration.6503.b:0 "You brought one of the horses' saddles, for our study."
 fund_inspiration.6503.c:0 "You didn't dare disturb the dead."
 
#Fund Alchemical Text

 fund_inspiration.8013.t:0 "$fund_inspiration.title$ An Alchemical Treasure"
 fund_inspiration.8013.desc:0 ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]," My alchemist [inspiration_owner.GetTitledFirstName] practically runs up to me, giddy as a child.\n\n"I found this book when visiting the market in [barony_market.GetName]. It is a book attributed to the fabled alchemist Alqama A'Bahlith – the master himself! At least according to the merchant... Nevertheless, just imagine the wealth of knowledge contained within!""
 fund_inspiration.8013.a:0 "Thank you, I will study this."
 fund_inspiration.8013.a_tt:0 "You keep the book"
 fund_inspiration.8013.b:0 "I trust you will make good use of the book."
 fund_inspiration.8013.b_tt:0 "You give the book to [inspiration_owner.GetShortUINameNoTooltip]"
 fund_inspiration.8013.c:0 "What a find! It is sure to fetch a hefty price."
